							<h2>Getting out in the Durham Countryside</h2>
							<p>Durham has a wealth of gentle countryside surrounding the City,
							which makes a great setting for exploring, both walking and running.
							A good start is usually to follow the river bank paths, but if you'd
							like any suggestions, speak to one of the locals.
